Internal Structure\n","A dictionary in Python is implemented using a hash table, which consists of:\n","Keys: Unique identifiers that are immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, or tuples).\n","Values: Data associated with each key, which can be of any type.\n","Hash Function: A function that converts keys into an index where the value is stored.\n","\n","2.

How Data is Retrieved\n","When accessing a value using a key, Python rehashes the key.\n","It checks the computed hash index and retrieves the value in constant time\n","\n","4. Collision Handling\n","Since multiple keys may produce the same hash (a collision), Python uses Open Addressing with Probing:\n","If a collision occurs, Python searches for the next available slot in the table.\n","This ensures fast lookups while maintaining efficiency.\n","\n","5.
